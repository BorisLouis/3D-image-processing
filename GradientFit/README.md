The code is based in the article: **Fast and Precise 3D Fluorophore Localization based on Gradient Fitting** 2015 Scientific reports. Full reference with link:
[Ma, H., Xu, J., Jin, J., Gao, Y., Lan, L., & Liu, Y. Scientific Reports, 5(1), 14335.](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep14335)

I have, however, cleaned their code substantially. **A full description of the equations can be found on [this post](https://camachodejay.github.io/GradientFit/)**
